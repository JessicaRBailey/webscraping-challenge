# webscraping-challenge
Challenge 11

In this repository, you will find two jupyter notebooks.  Both notebooks use Splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a webpage. 
The first one captures the current titles and blurbs on a website containing news articles from Mars and saves them into a json file called mars_articles.json.  
The second one scrapes data from a table containing weather data about Mars recorded over a 6 year period by the Curiosity Rover and analyses the average temperature and pressure visually using matplotlib.  The table scraped from the website is also saved as a csv file called Mars_weather.csv.
